# Ludum Dare 50 - Delay the inevitable (The Inevitable Abyss)

The Inevitable Abyss is... inevitable. Survival is the name of the game.

Just your boring basic platformer. Well, almost anyways (almost a platformer that is). I didn't finish editing the level, so it ends real quick.
Controls are w, space, or up to jump. a, d, left, right, to move left and right.

I spent so much time on player movement, getting it just the way I wanted. Then at the end, I made one little change, and now the movement is not at all how I intended. Unfortunately, the change didn't cause a bug; I need to rethink how I handle the y-axis movement. I'm more disappointed than you know about that. Oh well. I will look to fix that for a post release. I will also have to add more platforms, I might try making a level editor.
